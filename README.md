# Bootstrap Tourist Dev Branch

This is the unstable/new-backdrop branch of Tourist. Purpose is to migrate away from the 4 div backdrop solution to a single div / zindex solution. This solves a number of issues/restrictions and significantly enhances how Tourist works.

All major work by and thanks to @ibastevan
